# Node Auth 1 Guided Project

Guided project for **Node Auth 1** Module.

## Prerequisites

- [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.
- [ ] type `npm run server` to start the API.

Please follow along as the instructor adds authentication to the API.

## Encryption vs Hashing

- for password storage use hashing, because encryption is two way, but hashing is one way. Once hashed there is no (easy) way of getting the original string back.

## Auth workflow

- register an account.
- login.
- log out.
- restrict access to resources.

## Tokens

The server does not store information, the information is stored on the token. There is no session to destroy.

### Server

- on successful login/register, produce token and send the token to the client
- on following requests, verify the token
- if token is good, provide access, if not, block access

### Client

- store the token (memory, local storage, header....).
- send the token on every request.
- destroy the token on logout.
